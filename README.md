# Hi! 👋🏼
## Here is my project submission for [RUN System](https://runsystem.id/id/)

This is a List of Pokemon with abilities and type shown built with ReactJS.

🎉 These are the current features:

- Pagination
- Search Feature
- Items per-page

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd /RUN Test
npm i
npm start
```

## Resources

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

I used https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon API for this project.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
